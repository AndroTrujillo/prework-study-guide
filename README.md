# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I started to build this project as part of the Study Guide to learn and pass my Prework for boot camp. Learning basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JS.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (MacOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panle should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from Prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
